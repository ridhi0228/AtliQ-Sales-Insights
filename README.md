AtliQ Hardware

- The company has a head office in Dehli and regional offices throughout India.

Business Issue
The sales director is facing a lot of challenges such as:
The marketing is growing dynamically and then heâ€™s struggling in terms of tracking the sales, needing more accurate insights about the company sales, and then take the necessary decisions.

I used SQL queries in MySQL Workbench to take a look into the data and Power BI for ETL and visualizations to create the insights.

    `SELECT * FROM customers;`

    `SELECT distinct product_code FROM transactions where market_code='Mark001';`

1. Show transactions where currency is US dollars

    `SELECT * from transactions where currency="USD"`

1. Show transactions in 2020 join by date table

    `SELECT transactions.*, date.* FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020;`

1. Show total revenue in year 2020,

    `SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) FROM transactions INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date=date.date where date.year=2020 and transactions.currency="INR\r" or transactions.currency="USD\r";`
	
1. Show total revenue in year 2020, January Month,
